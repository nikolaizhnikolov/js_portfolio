Priority:
Style main page.
Research how to make it more modular OR have more control over it.
This could transition to a full portfolio not only a JS one.

Etch exercises:
 - Modularize
 - Change all func decl to func expressions.
 - I don't really need a dependency manager tho.
 - Have init as a scoped anonymous function.

 In the future:
 Redo this whole thing with Node.js and React
 Host it yourself
 Add Navigation to projects instead of the current layout.
 
 Calculator:
   Add Keyboard support
   0-9
   <=
   +-/*%
