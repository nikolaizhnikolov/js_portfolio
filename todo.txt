Priority:
Style main page.
Rename JS portfolio to simply portfolio
Research how to make it more modular OR have more control over it.
This should transition to a full portfolio not only a JS one.

Etch exercises:
 - Modularize
 - Change all func decl to func expressions.
 - I don't really need a dependency manager tho.
 - Have init as a scoped anonymous function.

DONE: 

Add Indexing to Main TOP_Projects page
 - Make it public.
 - Push it to github pages.
Change readme to index.html and see if GH pages is fine with it.
